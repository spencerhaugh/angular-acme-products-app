# Angular Application

This is an Angular application I built following the Angular course on Pluralsight from Deborah Kurata.  
It utilizes many Angular specific features such as Injectors, Pipes, and more. The APM-Start folder is where all the code I wrote lives. The APM-Final folder is the solution files from the instructor.
